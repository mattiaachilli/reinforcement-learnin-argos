# reinforcement-learnin-argos

The goal of the project is to design and implement a system composed of a robot that
avoids the black parts of the unknown environment as much as possible. Basically the robot must try to stay as much as possible in the white areas of the environment. The problem was analyzed and developed through reinforcement learning using the Q-learning algorithm and Lua programming language.
